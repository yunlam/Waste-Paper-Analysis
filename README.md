# Waste-Paper-Analysis
This report is to analyze the data from the waste paper inspection unit and assess the waste paper collection and operators on the moisture content of waste papers stored in their plants and the papers loaded into the cargo containers in advance to the mainland China. 

We hope to find out any abnormality in high moisture content of waste papers whether exist cheating by the operators, such that the high moisture may be caused by intentionally watering the papers and mixing the papers with other materials as a result of weight gain to the papers before loading them into the cargo container; the more weight the waste paper is, the more in monetary incentive the operator from the papers is earned.

Consideration:
1) The cargo container in which the waste papers contain extra-ordinary high moisture content of waste papers by the time in comparison with others, which the waste paper collection and operators are responsible for those containers. 
2) Weather (rainy day, high humidity) whether cause to the waste paper with extra-ordinary high moisture or got wet.
3) The plants of the waste paper operators whether exist problems with the paper storage
